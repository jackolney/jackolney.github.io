      <description>For the second year in a row, I was invited to speak at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). This year the conference was held in one of my favourite cities, Seattle.
I spoke about my new web-based modelling tool that enables countries to enter data on their HIV care programmes, estimate the achievement of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 and prioritise strategies to achieve these goals by the target date of 2020.</description>

      <description>I was recently invited to speak at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), held this year in Boston. I spoke briefly about some of my work on home-based counselling and testing programmes in western Kenya, particularly with regard to the timing of testing rounds and the scale up of testing programmes to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets by 2020.</description>
