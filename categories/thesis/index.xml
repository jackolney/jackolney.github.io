After hearing stories from other students of 24-hour stints in the library and solid weekends spent slaving over their theses in the final months, I figured there must be another way. Sometime during my second year, I devised a plan for writing the thesis:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I figured that if I was aiming to submit my thesis in October I had about 10 months, or 40 weeks in order to make a substantial dent in the thesis before having to switch to writing full-time. Excluding weekends, 40 weeks of an hour a day works out at 200 hours.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
