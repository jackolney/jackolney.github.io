faster than ever before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pertinent example of this is the current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). In early February 2020,
merely days after the first cases were confirmed in the UK, the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-of-health-and-social-care">Department of Health and Social Care&lt;/a>
along with &lt;a href="https://www.ukri.org/">UK Research &amp;amp; Innovation&lt;/a> announced a Â£20M investment to
facilitate rapid research on the virus by world-class UK academic and industry experts&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
Encouragingly, this announcement was met with great interest across the sector and my hope is this
funding will enable us to ultimately control the current outbreak.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
