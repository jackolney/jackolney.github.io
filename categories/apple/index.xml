      <description>Overview Having owned an Apple Watch since early May, I have built up a substantial amount of data in Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;HealthKit&amp;rsquo;, detailing my daily steps from in excess of a year prior to owning the watch to at least six months after. Therefore, a simple analysis of whether the watch has improved my fitness should be possible. Additionally, I can pull out heart-rate data, stair-flight data, exercise data and map a whole bunch of other interesting stuff.</description>

      <description>Having just watched the latest Apple keynote, I have to admit at being quite impressed at the latest products. Even John Gruber got it wrong! After flat-out claiming there would be no iPadPro announcement, there we have it! But the internet seems rather pre-occupied by the smile issue, and the pencil.
Regarding the smile, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.
Regarding the pencil, I kind of think is works. Or at least, it&amp;rsquo;s the right time for a stylus.</description>
