      <title>Rapid access to health data in the UK</title>

      <description>In the field of public health, there is a need to access health and healthcare-related data much faster than ever before.
A pertinent example of this is the current coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19). In early February 2020, merely days after the first cases were confirmed in the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care along with UK Research &amp;amp; Innovation announced a £20M investment to facilitate rapid research on the virus by world-class UK academic and industry experts1.</description>

      <description>For the second year in a row, I was invited to speak at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI). This year the conference was held in one of my favourite cities, Seattle.
I spoke about my new web-based modelling tool that enables countries to enter data on their HIV care programmes, estimate the achievement of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 and prioritise strategies to achieve these goals by the target date of 2020.</description>

      <title>Writing a PhD Thesis</title>
      <link>https://jackolney.github.io/posts/2016-11-17-thesis/</link>

      <description>Right from the start of my PhD, I was keen to avoid leaving the &amp;ldquo;writing up&amp;rdquo; stage until the last moment. After hearing stories from other students of 24-hour stints in the library and solid weekends spent slaving over their theses in the final months, I figured there must be another way. Sometime during my second year, I devised a plan for writing the thesis:
For the final year of my PhD I was going to wake up an hour earlier than usual, and before doing anything else, write for a solid couple of hours I figured that if I was aiming to submit my thesis in October I had about 10 months, or 40 weeks in order to make a substantial dent in the thesis before having to switch to writing full-time.</description>

      <title>Webfonts in ggplot2</title>

      <description>Thanks to Hadley&amp;rsquo;s ggplot2 package, we are no longer confined to base graphics plots in R. However, by default all fonts are generated using the &amp;lsquo;Helvetica&amp;rsquo; family. Now this is a great sans serif font, as evidenced by the fact that it is use literally everywhere in everything.
But now that we have these incredible graphical capabilities, and the ability to produce FiveThirtyEight quality figures, we should really explore how to enhance our plots further with the use of better fonts.</description>

      <title>Future Needs for Characterising the HIV Care Cascade</title>

      <description>As we progress toward the end of the fourth decade of the HIV epidemic, substantial progress has been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality of those living with HIV12, particularly due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART)3. However, we must pause, and assess the current state of the epidemic to understand where limited resources are best utilised. At present, countries are inadequately prepared to evaluate the prospect of achieving the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets by 2020, but with further enhancements they could be4.</description>

      <title>Shiny Progress Bars</title>
      <link>https://jackolney.github.io/posts/2016-04-01-shiny/</link>

      <description>Lately, I have been working on developing a friendly shiny app around a mathematical model to enable non-modellers to get to grips with the model, play around and perhaps learn something too. This has really been as much about teaching myself Shiny as it has been about enabling others to interact with models.
Shiny, is great package being developed by a handful of developers at RStudio, and it enables anyone to wrap their R code in an HTML front-end that will run on any computer with R installed, and perhaps most importantly, run on any computer if deployed to a Linux server running ShinyServer.</description>

      <description>I was recently invited to speak at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), held this year in Boston. I spoke briefly about some of my work on home-based counselling and testing programmes in western Kenya, particularly with regard to the timing of testing rounds and the scale up of testing programmes to achieve the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets by 2020.</description>

      <title>Hubot - a Siri to call my own</title>
      <link>https://jackolney.github.io/posts/2016-01-09-hubot/</link>

      <description>I have always been interested in how these automated personal assistants: Siri, Google Now, Cortana etc. actually function. Aside from the speech recognition algorithms, the meaning of the sentence spoken to these programs must be deciphered and then acted upon pretty quickly. &amp;lsquo;Trigger&amp;rsquo; words are clearly important here e.g. &amp;ldquo;give me directions to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; but the breadth of words that a computer must understand in order to appear human is simply vast.</description>

      <title>Has the Apple Watch improved my fitness?</title>

      <description>Overview Having owned an Apple Watch since early May, I have built up a substantial amount of data in Apple&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;HealthKit&amp;rsquo;, detailing my daily steps from in excess of a year prior to owning the watch to at least six months after. Therefore, a simple analysis of whether the watch has improved my fitness should be possible. Additionally, I can pull out heart-rate data, stair-flight data, exercise data and map a whole bunch of other interesting stuff.</description>

      <title>Interactive Dynamic Models in R</title>

      <description>As part of a new work package I am part of, we needed to develop a dynamic transmission model of HIV care that has a relatively user-friendly interface and that can be run on almost any device.
The initial choice was to go with an Excel spreadsheet, and have a tab hidden in the background with the model running and a whole bunch of simple stuff at the front for the user to interact with.</description>

      <title>Apple Pencil</title>

      <description>Having just watched the latest Apple keynote, I have to admit at being quite impressed at the latest products. Even John Gruber got it wrong! After flat-out claiming there would be no iPadPro announcement, there we have it! But the internet seems rather pre-occupied by the smile issue, and the pencil.
Regarding the smile, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.
Regarding the pencil, I kind of think is works. Or at least, it&amp;rsquo;s the right time for a stylus.</description>

      <title>Calling R from a Python instance</title>

      <description>After spending several hours today trying to figure out how to call R from an instance of Python running on the departmental cluster, I figured that I better document this.
Why bother? Some background on my problem. I have an individual-based model written in C++ that describes the HIV epidemic in Kenya over time from 1970 to 2036/2056. This model is called through R which supplies a whole bunch of arguments allowing me to simulate a whole bunch of different scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fun with GoogleDocs API</title>
      <link>https://jackolney.github.io/posts/2015-01-01-fun-with-googledocs/</link>

      <description>I wanted to document some code for accessing documents (only spreadsheets at the moment) through GoogleDocs using the DIDE cluster and R.
Getting started. The R code is fairly self explanatory but involves two little tricks to get it to work: (1) manipulating the GoogleDocs URL to export the document as a csv and (2) changes the privilages on the document such that anyone with the link can edit (done under sharing).</description>

      <description>Taking comfort in the fact that I am sure that nobody will read this site except me, I have decided to procrastinate by writing something about a problem, or perhaps I should say challange that I am currently facing. To add some background, I have written an individual-based time-to-event model that describes a series of events that make up HIV care. I have written this model purely in C++, but as it was my first &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; model and I was still learning C++ at the time, I have since thought about revisiting the source code and changing the fundamentals of the model.</description>
