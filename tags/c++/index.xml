      <description>Taking comfort in the fact that I am sure that nobody will read this site except me, I have decided to procrastinate by writing something about a problem, or perhaps I should say challange that I am currently facing. To add some background, I have written an individual-based time-to-event model that describes a series of events that make up HIV care. I have written this model purely in C++, but as it was my first &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; model and I was still learning C++ at the time, I have since thought about revisiting the source code and changing the fundamentals of the model.</description>
