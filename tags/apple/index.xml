      <description>Having just watched the latest Apple keynote, I have to admit at being quite impressed at the latest products. Even John Gruber got it wrong! After flat-out claiming there would be no iPadPro announcement, there we have it! But the internet seems rather pre-occupied by the smile issue, and the pencil.
Regarding the smile, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t care less.
Regarding the pencil, I kind of think is works. Or at least, it&amp;rsquo;s the right time for a stylus.</description>
