      <description>Lately, I have been working on developing a friendly shiny app around a mathematical model to enable non-modellers to get to grips with the model, play around and perhaps learn something too. This has really been as much about teaching myself Shiny as it has been about enabling others to interact with models.
Shiny, is great package being developed by a handful of developers at RStudio, and it enables anyone to wrap their R code in an HTML front-end that will run on any computer with R installed, and perhaps most importantly, run on any computer if deployed to a Linux server running ShinyServer.</description>
