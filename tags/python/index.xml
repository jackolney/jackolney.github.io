      <description>After spending several hours today trying to figure out how to call R from an instance of Python running on the departmental cluster, I figured that I better document this.
Why bother? Some background on my problem. I have an individual-based model written in C++ that describes the HIV epidemic in Kenya over time from 1970 to 2036/2056. This model is called through R which supplies a whole bunch of arguments allowing me to simulate a whole bunch of different scenarios.</description>
